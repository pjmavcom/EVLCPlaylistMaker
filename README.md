# EVLCPlaylistMaker
Quick app to sort through directories and make a playlist of the media files in there

Either run the file and choose a directory or drag a directory onto the .exe. This will go through all the directories and make a playlist for each root folder as well as a master playlist for all the directories. These playlists are relative to the media files paths.

It will look for mp3, mp4, m4v, mkv and webm files. Pretty obvious in the code where to add extra file types if you want. 
Made specifically for VLC and downloaded YouTube files.
